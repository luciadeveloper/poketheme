The functionality added to Understrap theme:

Everything has been added in poketheme/inc/pokemon except for the CTP template

- (1 and 2) New custom post type called Pokemon 
- (3) Three Pokemon posts added when activating the theme
- (2) Those Pokemon posts are filled with data retrieved form an API endpoint
- (4) A custom template for the CTP is been created. Can be found in poketheme/loop-templates/content-single-pokemon.php
- Tree Endpoints created:
    - (7) /wp-json/add-pokemon/random/ : adds a new pokemon post to the DB, and fills it with the information provided by the API, the same as when activating the theme. 
    - (6) /wp-json/get-pokemon/random/ : shows the post of a random Pokemon from the DB. (with a redirection to the post page)
    - (8) /wp-json/list-pokemons/bypokedex: shows a list of pokemons from the DB, (name and pokedex number) and sorts them by pokedex number. 

- (8) To consult the data of a pokemon post, is not necessary to create a new endpoint. The metadata created for the post is enabled to be displayed in the REST API, so we can make a simple call indicating the data field we need.
        - http://domain.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pokemon/{post id}}?_fields=metadata.weight,metadata.name,metadata.description //specific fields
        - http://domain.com/wp-json/wp/v2/pokemon/{post id}]?_fields=metadata //all fields

        example: http://poketest.local/wp-json/wp/v2/pokemon/2226?_fields=metadata

- A test has been added, which can be found in /tests

- (9) There is some level of abstraction so changing the API to retrieve the Pokemon data could be done with some work. 
    -  The creation of the Custom post type is abstract. 
    -  I would have to change class and function names, and use something more general than "pokemon". Animal?
    -  Some simple changes like the API endpoint and some other vars. 

- (10)  In case of heavy use of the DB:
    - There is a fixed number of Pokemons in the API, so I would limit the number of pokemon posts created in WordPress, making sure they are no repeated Pokemons. 
    - Limit on time the attempts to call the new endpoints, especially the one creating new Pokemon Posts. 
    - Retrieving the Attacks of a Pokemon in the PokeApi is a heavy task. I would consider if is necessary. I could develop somehting so it is only called when really needed.


Notes: 

    - I spent some time understanding the PokÃ©API and especially the Pokemons world. I had no previous knowledge of it. Probably too much.
    - I assumed "attacks" (2 h) to be "moves", but could not find a "description" field, so I used "type"->"name". There is no field called "description".
    - Initially, I used ACF, including it in the theme plugins. I discarded this option as the native WordPress custom fields were enough. And the project is more simple like this. 



== Installation ==

    - Download the theme and add it to your themes folder /wp-content/themes
    - Activate it in the dashboard or use WP-CLI. 
    - Check the custom fields are enabled on your site. Go to Pokemon post, ..., preferences, panels, Custom Fields.

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 = first launch

== Next ==

- Pokemon post properties Primary and Secondary type of Pokemon could be a category.
- When creating 3 new pokemons, I assumed they are different. There is a small chance of getting the same pokemon twice, as I am using the PHP function rand(). SOLVED
- CPT template styles. The Attacs table needs a way to make it shorter. A fixed height with a scroll inside for example. (max-height: 200px; overflow: scroll; display: block;)
- Pokemons archive page filter
- When creating a new Pokemon post, check there is no other Pokemon post with the same info (could be only a check on the name) SOLVED
- This functionality could be in a plugin so it is easier to add to any WordPress website. 
- Fix: The permision callback in register_rest_route does not work properly in this code.
